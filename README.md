Visualization of network communities and centrality measures
Custom implementation of the Barab√°si-Albert (BA) model
Study of network properties including:

Degree distribution analysis at different network sizes (100, 1000, 10000 nodes)
Average clustering coefficient calculation
Growth tracking of initial nodes
Network robustness analysis



Technical Components:

NetworkX for graph manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib for network visualization
Custom implementations of network metrics
Efficient algorithms for large-scale network analysis

Visualizations Include:

Community detection with color-coded nodes
Degree centrality represented by node sizes
Log-scale degree distribution plots
Clustering coefficient evolution
Temporal degree growth analysis
